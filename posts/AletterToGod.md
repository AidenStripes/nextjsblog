Man You see everything cuz You're the GOD   
I wanted end myself cuz things got tough    
not only because of that    
I also know You are the ultimate path    
But say something to me    
I've just had enough     
How many times I should thank You 4 that lives    
I wanna go for an exchange, MAN just play Your part    
If it's that ain't noble enough     
Where I should start      
You don't owe me any answer       
But I put their lives above mine     
Maybe You don't believe me or I can't handle the truth    
How evil can be defeated by good?
And I ain't take that weight by my own       
The seed was sown but maybe I should be unborn      
I have no power to throw a lightning back      
stuck in the endless fight      
Maybe this night will be my last flight      
I'm not blaming You no way just tell me good night      
Let's say everybody's equal       
Don't get me wrong I'm pissed off      
I make my people      
more important than me Dawg       
for me it's more like an auto diss song       
just tell me if a 5 yo kid should go see You      
tell me why You need to      
have them next to You ask them first If they wanna be blissful      
I'm not telling that You should leave'em        
but maybe they wanted push through       
Ok nobody's good as Your son       
but it doesn't mean that I should feel sorry for having a breath in my lungs       
You love them so much so they are now done      
I live the best way I can You can destroy me in a simple strike      
but I was less at the start      
sometimes I'm mad as hell         
and even start my talkshit        
but I got a story to tell         
And know that You love me
